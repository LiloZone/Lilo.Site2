sobreTitulo: About
sobreCabecalho: We are a Prototype Factory, where it is possible to do (almost) everything.
sobreConteudo: LILO.ZONE is a shared workshop that hosts projects and entrepreneurial initiatives in creative use of technology and the movement maker. Our space provides the entire infrastructure to create and transform ideas into functional prototypes. More than a physical space, we are a community, a rich network of professionals specializing in technology, innovation and creativity that provides the human structure that drives great ideas. 
SobreFraseFinal: Come prototyping with us!

lemaCabecalho: Prototipar é preciso!
lemaConteudo: Prototyping is necessary to validate ideas in the real world. The process of generating a product involves material limitations and consists of a cycle of drawing, testing, refining the drawing, testing again, until it reaches the final version. Hence the importance of being in a space like LILO.ZONE, which has all the structure to assemble these prototypes and a community of rich interactions. Here we do not just believe in "Do it yourself", but in "Let's do it together!"
